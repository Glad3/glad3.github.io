## About Me

I am currently a student at Staffordshire University doing BSc (Hons) Computer Games Developement. I have a huge passion for games, both making them and playing them. I am also a massive sports fan, especially Football (Liverpool, YNWA!) and American Football (SEAHAWKS). My knowledge in making games comes from a development side so with the use of engines like UE4 and Unity, but also with knowledge of c++ and c#. In this Webfolio, you will find Projects I have worked on and also currently worked on that I am proud to showcase and also future plan. I hope you enjoy what you see. :D
